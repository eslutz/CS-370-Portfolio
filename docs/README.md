# CS-370-Portfolio

Portfolio containing the assignments and project from CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science.

## Module 2 Assignment

[Assignment 2](../Module%202%20Assignment/Slutz_Eric_Assignment2.ipynb)

In this assignment involved modifying the parameters of a neural network in Keras and how changing the parameters effected the results.

## Module 3 Assignment

[Assignment 3](../Module%203%20Assignment/Slutz_Eric_Assignment3.ipynb)

This assignment involved training a convolutional neural networks in Keras and using it to make predictions.

## Module 5 Assignment

[Assignment 5](../Module%205%20Assignment/Slutz_Eric_Assignment5.ipynb)

For this assignment, it involved working with OpenAI Gym to apply the concepts of Q-learning algorithms to the “cartpole” problem, a common reinforcement learning problem.

## Project

[Main Project File](../Project/Slutz_Eric_ProjectTwo.ipynb)

In this project we needed to complete the Q-Training Algorithm code block.  The goal of the deep Q-learning implementation is to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward.  Other than the training algorithm, we were given all other code for the treasure maze project.
